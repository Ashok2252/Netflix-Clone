# Netflix-Clone

## Building Netflix from Scratch Using React (Custom Hooks, Context, Portals), Firebase, Compound & Styled Components

* This application (a Netflix clone) was built using React (Custom Hooks, Context), Firebase & Styled Components.
* I have built the following pages within this application: sign in, sign up, browse & lastly the homepage.
* There are four different pages, some using protected routes with auth listeners.
* Firebase firestore handles all the data and that data is retrieved using a custom hook; authentication is used on all pages, which is handled by Firebase as well.
